Tianheng is a postgraduate of Rehabilitation Engineering & Assistive Technology student at University College London (UCL). His research interests include computational mechanics, biomechanics and lightweight structural optimization with the lattice structures. He was recruited as a research assistant (RA) focusing on the computational mechanics of the lattice structures, and led the research project which developed an extremely lightweight medical exoskeleton device.
